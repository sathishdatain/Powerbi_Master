Hi, I’m Sathish Kumar. I work as a Data Analyst with hands-on experience in SQL, Power BI, and Python, working across healthcare, insurance, and finance domains 
mainly focusing on data cleaning, data modeling, and building dashboards.
In my recent healthcare projects, I worked on patient records, claims data and operational KPIs. 
I also used SQL to optimize data extraction from large database, designing Power BI dashboards using DAX, Power Query, and Row-Level Security, and using Python for data cleaning and automation.
I regularly collaborate with cross-functional teams to gather requirements, validate data, and translate business needs into actionable insights.
I’m looking for a role where I can contribute to data-driven improvements and build scalable analytics solutions.
