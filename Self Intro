Hi, I’m Sathish Kumar. I work as a Data Analyst with hands-on experience in SQL, Power BI, and Python, 
across healthcare, insurance, and finance domains. My work mainly focuses on data cleaning, data modeling, 
analyzing large datasets, and building dashboards that support decision-making.

In my recent healthcare project, I worked with patient records, claims data, and operational KPIs. 
I used SQL to optimize data extraction from large databases, which improved the performance of reporting workflows. 
I designed interactive Power BI dashboards using DAX, Power Query, and Row-Level Security, and published them to the Power BI Service with scheduled refreshes.
These dashboards helped track key metrics like patient admissions, claim turnaround time, and provider performance.

I also use Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for data cleaning and automation

I collaborate closely with cross-functional teams to gather requirements, validate data, and convert business 
needs into clear, actionable insights. 

I’m now looking for a role where I can contribute to data-driven improvements and build scalable analytics solutions.
