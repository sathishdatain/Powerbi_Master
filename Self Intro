Hi, I’m Sathish Kumar. I work as a Data Analyst with hands-on experience in SQL, Power BI, and Python, 
across healthcare, insurance, and finance domains. My work mainly focuses on data cleaning, data modeling, 
analyzing large datasets, and building dashboards that support decision-making.

In my recent healthcare projects, I worked on patient records, claims data, and operational KPIs. I optimized 
data extraction using SQL on large databases and designed Power BI dashboards using DAX, Power Query, 
and Row-Level Security.

I also use Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for data cleaning and automation

I collaborate closely with cross-functional teams to gather requirements, validate data, and convert business 
needs into clear, actionable insights. I’m now looking for a role where I can contribute to data-driven 
improvements and build scalable analytics solutions.
