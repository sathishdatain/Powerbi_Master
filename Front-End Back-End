 Data Visualization :
 ==================
Creating dashboards and reports with charts, tables, slicers, and maps.
Using built-in visuals like bar charts, pie charts, line graphs, and custom visuals from AppSource.
Implementing KPIs, scorecards, and conditional formatting for better insights.

Interactivity & User Experience
===============================	
Adding filters, slicers, and drill-through options.
Enabling tooltips and dynamic interactions between visuals.
Implementing bookmarks and navigation buttons for guided analytics.

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
===============================
Writing DAX formulas for calculated columns, measures, and aggregations.
Creating time intelligence functions (YTD, QTD, MTD).
Implementing row-level security (RLS) to restrict data access.

Deployment & Sharing
=====================
Publishing reports to Power BI Service and embedding in applications.
Sharing dashboards with stakeholders and setting up scheduled refresh.
Exporting reports to PDF, PowerPoint, or Excel as needed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Connectivity & Integration
===============================
Connecting to various sources: SQL Server, Excel, APIs, SharePoint, Cloud Databases (Azure, AWS).
Using DirectQuery or Import Mode based on performance needs.

Power Query (ETL - Extract, Transform, Load)
============================================
Cleaning and transforming data (removing duplicates, merging queries, handling null values).
Creating custom columns and calculated tables using M language.
Unpivoting columns, splitting data, and merging datasets.

Performance Optimization
========================
Implementing data modeling best practices (Star Schema, Fact & Dimension tables).
Using aggregations and indexing to improve performance.
Reducing dataset size by optimizing queries and using Power BI Aggregations.

Security & Governance
=====================
Setting up Row-Level Security (RLS) for access control.
Defining User Roles and Permissions in Power BI Service.
Configuring data refresh schedules to keep reports updated.
